This app is just a personal project to practice my skills using a MERN stack. 

This is just the frontend of the applicaton, which is connected to Netlify so it can be deployed every time is updated on this repo. 

The application was made using REACT/Bootstrap components. 

The backend was made using Node.js and the Express framework. To visit the backend, review the following link: https://github.com/AsaelCorona115/EldenApp.
